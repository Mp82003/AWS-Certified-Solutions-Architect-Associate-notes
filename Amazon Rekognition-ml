How Amazon Rekognition Works
Two API Sets
1. Amazon Rekognition Image
Analyzes static images
Example Use Case: Photo management application
Customer uploads photo
Rekognition detects real-world objects or faces
Store detected information

Users can query photos by:
Specific objects
Specific faces
Facial expressions (smiling, crying)
Age of people
Other attributes

2. Amazon Rekognition Video
Analyzes videos (stored and streaming)
Stored Video: Track path of people
Streaming Video: Search for persons whose facial descriptions match stored descriptions
Real-time video analysis capabilities

Key Features of Amazon Rekognition
1. Labels
Definition: Object, scene, action, or concept found in an image or video based on its contents

Capabilities:
Detects objects (skateboard, cars, wheels)
Detects people
Detects scenes
Returns bounding boxes for detected objects
Provides confidence scores (percentage)

Example Detection:
Person: 99.3% confidence
Outdoors: 83.1% confidence
Rock: 82.8% confidence
Available in: Both Rekognition Image and Rekognition Video

2. Text Detection
Capabilities:
Detects text in images and videos
Converts detected text into machine-readable text
Recognizes text in various fonts, sizes, and orientations

Use Cases:
Use Case          Description
Visual Search     Retrieve/display images with same text content
Insights          Identify themes in recognized text from video frames
Content Search    Search for news, sports scores, athlete numbers, captions
Navigation        Speech-enabled apps for visually impaired (restaurant names, shop signs, street signs)
Filtering         Filter PII (Personally Identifiable Information) from images
Video Search      Find clips with specific text keywords (e.g., guest names on graphics)
Public Safety     Detect car license plate numbers from traffic cameras

3. Face Detection and Analysis
Core Capability: Store facial information in server-side containers called Collections

What is a Collection?
Server-side container for facial information
Must be created in an AWS region in your account
Stores facial feature information for all faces

Key Operation: IndexFaces
Detects faces in input image
Adds faces to specified collection
Stores facial feature information

Workflow:
Create a face collection
Use IndexFaces operation to add faces
Store facial feature information
Search collection for face matches

Use Cases:
User verification
Cataloging people
People counting
Public safety applications
Search for known faces in:
Images
Stored videos
Streaming videos

4. Streaming Video Events Detection
Purpose: Detect labels in streaming video in real-time
How It Works:
Step 1: Create Stream Processor
Manages analysis of streaming video
Choose what to detect:
People
Pets
Packages

Step 2: Video Processing
Uses Amazon Kinesis Video Streams to receive and process video

Step 3: Output
Analysis results sent to:
Amazon S3 bucket
Amazon SNS notifications

Use Cases:
