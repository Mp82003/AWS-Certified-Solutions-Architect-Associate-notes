A. ENI
B. ENA
C. EFA only
D. None

✔ Correct Answer: B. ENA
Explanation: ENA supports up to 100 Gbps networking.

8. A parallel scientific simulation using MPI needs the lowest latency possible. Best NIC?

A. ENI
B. ENA
C. EFA
D. Secondary Private IP

✔ Correct Answer: C. EFA
Explanation: MPI-based workloads are tightly coupled → EFA is designed for this.

9. What happens when using EFA in non–OS-bypass mode?

A. Traffic cannot be routed
B. Traffic can be routed across subnets
C. EFA is disabled
D. Only IPv6 works

✔ Correct Answer: B. Traffic can be routed across subnets
Explanation: Routing limits apply ONLY in OS-bypass mode.

10. You need a NIC supporting SR-IOV for high I/O performance and low CPU usage. Which one?

A. ENI
B. ENA
C. EFA
D. Internet Gateway

✔ Correct Answer: B. ENA
Explanation: ENA uses SR-IOV for enhanced performance.


1️⃣ ENI – Elastic Network Interface (Basic NIC)

Use case: General-purpose networking (web servers, app servers, DB servers).
Supported on: ALL EC2 instance types.

Key Features (MUST remember):

Primary private IPv4 address

Multiple secondary IPv4 addresses

1 Elastic IP per private IPv4

IPv6 support

One or more security groups

MAC address

Attach/detach between instances in the same AZ

When to choose ENI (Exam Clue):

No high-performance requirements

Basic VPC networking

Regular workloads

2️⃣ ENA – Elastic Network Adapter (High Performance NIC)

Use case: High throughput + low latency networking.
Supported on: Selected EC2 instance families (HVM only).

Key Features:

Uses SR-IOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization)

High performance:

Up to 100 Gbps network speed

Higher PPS (Packets per second)

Lower CPU utilization

Exam Clue (VERY IMPORTANT):

If the question asks:
✔ "High bandwidth?"
✔ "Low instance-to-instance latency?"
✔ "Need high PPS?"
👉 Choose ENA over ENI.

3️⃣ EFA – Elastic Fabric Adapter (Specialized HPC NIC)

Use case:

HPC (High Performance Computing)

Machine Learning

Tightly coupled cluster workloads (parallel computing)

Key Features:

Builds on ENA, but adds:
✔ OS-bypass feature
✔ Direct communication between application & NIC hardware
✔ Ultra-low latency

Comparable performance to on-prem HPC clusters

Two Modes of Operation:
A) OS bypass mode (Very important exam point):

SUPER low latency

Traffic cannot be routed

Must stay within a single subnet

For tightly-coupled HPC tasks
(MPI-based workloads like CFD, weather modeling, seismic processing, ML training)

B) Non–OS bypass mode:

Works like ENA

Traffic IS routable across subnets

Exam Clue:

If the question involves:
✔ MPI workloads
✔ HPC cluster
✔ ML training with ultra-fast communication
✔ Need direct NIC access
👉 Choose EFA.
