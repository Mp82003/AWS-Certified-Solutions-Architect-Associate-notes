How AWS Translate Works
Input/Output Process
Source Text (UTF-8) → Translation Model → Output Text (UTF-8)

Source Text: Text you want to translate (UTF-8 format)
Output Text: Translated text in target language (UTF-8 format)

Translation Model Components
1. Encoder
Reads source sentence one word at a time
Constructs semantic representation capturing the meaning
Builds understanding of the source content

2. Decoder
Uses semantic representation from encoder
Generates translation one word at a time in target language
Produces final translated output

3. Attention Mechanisms
Helps decoder focus on most relevant parts of source sentence
Ensures correct translation of words and phrases
Understands context for better translation accuracy

Language Support
Supported Languages (Examples)
Arabic
Chinese
Croatian
German
English
Many more languages

Language Pair Concept
Language Pair = Combination of source language + target language
Example: English → German
Example: Chinese → French

Use Cases
1. Multilingual User Experiences
Enable multilingual features in applications
Translate company content:
Meeting minutes
Technical reports
Knowledge base articles
Posts and communications
Translate interpersonal communications:

Email
In-game chat
Customer service chat
Connect customers and employees in preferred languages

2. Process & Manage Incoming Data
Analyze text from social media and news feeds in multiple languages
Search for information across languages (e.g., eDiscovery cases)
Process multilingual data streams

3. AWS Service Integration (Important for Exam!)
Amazon Comprehend-Extract named entities, sentiment, and key phrases from unstructured multilingual text (social media, etc.)
Amazon Transcribe-Create subtitles and live captioning in multiple languages
Amazon Polly-Speak translated content (text-to-speech in different languages)
Amazon S3-Translate document repositories stored in S3Amazon DynamoDBTranslate text stored in DynamoDB tables
Amazon Redshift-Translate text in data warehouse

Language-Independent Processing
By integrating with other AWS services, you can process content regardless of language, then translate as needed.

Pricing
Two Pricing Tiers
Translation TypePrice per Million CharactersStandard Translation$15Active & Custom Translation$60

Why Active Custom Translation Costs More?
