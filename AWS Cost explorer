Overview

Tool to view and analyze AWS costs and usage
Access: Free UI or Cost Explorer API ($0.01 per request)
Cannot be disabled once enabled

Key Features
Data Analysis
View last 12 months of historical data
Forecast next 12 months spending
Get Reserved Instance (RI) purchase recommendations
Export data as CSV files

Anomaly Detection
Uses machine learning to identify cost anomalies
Alerts when cost exceeds $100 OR 40% of expected spend
Detects misconfiguration, usage spikes, or billing errors


Access Management (3 Ways)
Management Account: Root user enables for all member accounts
Cost Explorer Settings: Control access to costs, refunds, credits, discounts, RI recommendations

Cost Types
Cost Type         Description
Unblended Usage   cost on the day chargedBlended Unblended cost + discounts Amortized Upfront costs spread across billing period (e.g., All-Upfront RI spread over 12 months)

Cost Drivers & Optimization
Common Drivers:
Number and type of resources
Region selection
Time of day usage
Data transfer volume

Optimization Strategies:
Scale down unused resources
Use Reserved/Spot Instances
Move to lower-cost regions
Implement Auto Scaling

Exam Tips
✅ Remember anomaly detection threshold: $100 or 40%
✅ Know the difference between unblended, blended, and amortized costs
✅ Understand amortization for upfront RI purchases
✅ Cost Explorer cannot be disabled after enabling
✅ API calls cost $0.01 each
✅ Forecasting uses historical data (12 months back/forward)

Initial Setup

First-time access: Takes 24-48 hours to enable
Shows current month cost + forecasted cost on homepage
Note: Spikes/outliers can affect forecast accuracy


Cost Explorer Console Components
1. Chart Types

Line Chart: Trend visualization
Stack Chart: Layered view with color-coded services
Hover over bars to see detailed cost breakdown

2. Date Range & Granularity
Custom date range: Select specific time periods

Granularity options:
Daily: Day-by-day breakdown
Monthly: Month-by-month view
Hourly: Only available for paid/non-free-tier accounts

Grouping (Dimensions)
View costs from different perspectives:
Dimension Shows ServiceCost per AWS service (ELB, WAF, KMS, etc.)RegionCost per AWS regionLinked AccountCost per member accountInstance TypeEC2 instance type breakdownUsage TypeSpecific usage patternsTagsCustom tag-based groupingResourcesIndividual resource costs
Example: Group by Service → Stack chart shows legend with color codes for each service

Filters
Narrow down cost data:

Service-specific: Filter by particular services (e.g., only Load Balancer costs)
Region-specific: Filter by region (e.g., ap-south-1 Mumbai)
Multiple filters: Combine filters (Service + Region)
Other filters:

Instance type
Usage type
Cost category
Refunds/Credits
Taxes (include/exclude)



Result: Service count and total cost adjust based on applied filters

Cost Types View
Switch between:

Unblended Cost (default)
Blended Cost
Amortized Cost

Set cost limits

Budget by:
Service usage
Region
Resource type
Time period

Trends
Monthly trends: Cost patterns over months
Service-wise trends: Usage insights per service
Requires sufficient historical data
Helpful for identifying cost/usage patterns


Exam Tips - Hands-On Scenarios
✅ Custom reports save time: No need to reapply filters/groups each visit
✅ Stack charts with grouping: Best for visualizing multi-service costs
✅ Filters are cumulative: Can combine multiple filters simultaneously
✅ Free tier limitation: No hourly granularity
✅ Anomaly detection minimum: $100 spend threshold
✅ CSV export: Available for all cost data
✅ Forecasting considers outliers: Spikes affect predictions
✅ 24-48 hour activation: Plan accordingly for new accounts

Common Use Cases

Identify cost spikes: Group by Service + Daily granularity
Multi-region analysis: Filter by Region dimension
Department chargeback: Group by Linked Account or Tags
Service optimization: Filter specific service + view trends
Budget planning: Use forecasts + create custom reports
