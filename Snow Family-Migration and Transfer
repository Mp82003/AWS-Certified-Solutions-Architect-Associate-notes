1️⃣ What is AWS Snow Family?
AWS Snow Family = Set of offline, rugged physical devices used to migrate large datasets into or out of AWS when:
Internet is slow, unreliable, or non-existent
Environment is remote / edge / non-data center
Need local compute + storage for edge processing

Members:
AWS Snowcone – smallest, portable
AWS Snowball – mid-size (Edge Storage / Edge Compute)
AWS Snowmobile – 45-foot shipping container for exabytes

Used to:
Move TB → PB → EB of data
Run edge computing workloads (IoT, ML inference, preprocessing)
Deploy local EC2 + IoT Greengrass

2️⃣ Standard Features of AWS Snow Family
✔ 1. Encryption (Automatic + Strong)
All data is encrypted with AES-256.

Keys managed by AWS KMS.
Keys never stored on device → secure even if stolen.

Exam Tip:
"If a Snow device is lost or stolen during transit, is customer data safe?"
YES → encryption + TPM + auto wipe.

✔ 2. On-board Computing
Devices can run:
EC2 instances
AWS IoT Greengrass
Local data filtering, preprocessing & compression

Useful for:
Remote locations (ships, oil rigs)
Military field data
Factory edge ML

✔ 3. End-to-End Tracking
E-ink shipping label (auto updates)
SNS notifications
Track using AWS Console

✔ 4. Anti-Tamper / Tamper Evident
Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
Hardware root of trust
Device re-initialized after each use

✔ 5. NFS Endpoint
Snow devices support:
NFS v3 & v4.1

Use case:
Mount device like a normal file share
Copy data from on-prem servers easily

✔ 6. Simple Management (AWS OpsHub GUI)
AWS OpsHub helps you:
Unlock / configure device
Launch EC2 instances on the device
Transfer files
Monitor data migration

✔ 7. Secure Erasure (NIST Wipe)
After migration:
AWS performs software erasure
Follows NIST 800-88 media sanitization standard

Ensures:
No customer data remains on device

3️⃣ Snow Family Members (Deep Dive)

4️⃣ Example Story to Remember Easily
💡 Imagine you run an exploration team in the Himalayas…
The team needs to store data with no internet → Snowcone
Base camp wants to run ML inferencing locally → Snowball Compute Optimized
After expedition ends, the company must migrate 10 PB archive → Snowmobile

5️⃣ Important Points for Exam
