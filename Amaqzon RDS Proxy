AWS RDS Proxy - Simplified Notes (Easy to Remember)
üéØ What is RDS Proxy?
Think of it as a "middleman" between your app and database

Manages database connections smartly
Fully managed by AWS (no setup headaches)


üîë Why Use RDS Proxy? (The BIG 3)
1. Connection Pooling üèä

Problem: Too many apps = Too many connections = Database overload
Solution: RDS Proxy reuses connections instead of creating new ones
Remember: Like sharing Uber rides instead of everyone driving separately

2. Auto Failover üîÑ

Problem: Database crashes = App goes down
Solution: Automatically switches to healthy database
Remember: Like having a backup generator that kicks in automatically

3. Security üîí

Problem: Passwords hardcoded in application code
Solution: Uses AWS Secrets Manager + IAM
Remember: No more passwords in code = Safer apps


üìù Simple Use Cases (When to Use)
Scenario                     Why RDS Proxy?
Lambda functions             Lambda creates TONS of connections ‚Üí RDS Proxy pools them
Traffic spikes               Black Friday sale? RDS Proxy handles the rush
Need high availability       Database fails? RDS Proxy switches automatically
Sensitive data               Manages credentials securely (no hardcoding)
Memory Trick: "LTHS" = Lambda, Traffic spikes, High availability, Security

‚úÖ Benefits (The Good Stuff)
S - Scalability (handles thousands of connections)
P - Performance (faster through connection reuse)  
S - Security (IAM + Secrets Manager)
A - Availability (auto failover)
```

**Memory Trick:** **"SPSA"** = **S**calability, **P**erformance, **S**ecurity, **A**vailability

## üìä RPO vs RTO (Super Simple)

### **RPO** = **R**ecovery **P**oint **O**bjective
- **"How much DATA can I lose?"**
- Measured in: **MINUTES**
- Example: RPO = 5 min ‚Üí Can lose max 5 minutes of data

### **RTO** = **R**ecovery **T**ime **O**bjective  
- **"How long can I be DOWN?"**
- Measured in: **HOURS or DAYS**
- Example: RTO = 1 hour ‚Üí Must be back up within 1 hour

**Memory Trick:**
- **RPO** = **P**oint = How much data **P**oof (gone)
- **RTO** = **T**ime = How much **T**ime down

## üß† Memory Palace Technique

**Imagine a PROXY (bouncer) at a nightclub:**

1. **Connection Pooling** = Bouncer manages who goes in (doesn't let everyone rush in at once)

2. **Failover** = If main dance floor closes, bouncer redirects to backup floor

3. **Security** = Bouncer checks IDs (IAM) and keeps guest list (Secrets Manager)

4. **Compatible Databases** = Only certain types of music allowed (no Oracle!)

5. **Cost** = You pay the bouncer for their service
