1️⃣ On-Demand Instances

✔ Default option
✔ Pay per second/hour
✔ No long-term commitment
✔ Highest cost, highest flexibility

📌 Best For:

Unpredictable workloads

Short experiments / testing

First-time deployments

2️⃣ Reserved Instances (RI)

✔ Commit to 1 year or 3 years
✔ Up to 75% cheaper than On-Demand
✔ Steady, predictable workloads
✔ Can choose Standard RI or Convertible RI

✔ RI Payment Types
Payment Option	Discount	Notes
All Upfront	Highest	Pay full cost upfront
Partial Upfront	Medium	Part upfront + monthly
No Upfront	Lowest	Monthly only

⚠️ Performance same for all payment modes.

📌 Best For:

Long-running apps

Stable usage (e.g., RDS, web servers)

3️⃣ Spot Instances

✔ Up to 90% cheaper
✔ Uses unused EC2 capacity
✔ Can be terminated with 2-minute warning

📌 Best For:

Batch jobs

Big data processing

Stateless apps

Fault-tolerant workloads

⚠️ Not recommended for:

Databases

Long transactions

Critical apps

4️⃣ Dedicated Hosts (pricing category)

✔ Pay for entire physical server
✔ You control instance placement
✔ Needed for license-restricted software (BYOL: Oracle, SQL Server)

🟪 2. EC2 Savings Plans (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)

Savings Plans = Newer alternative to RIs with FAR more flexibility.

✔ Save up to 72%
✔ Commit to spend $ per hour for 1 or 3 years
✔ Auto-applies to EC2, Fargate, Lambda

Savings Plans Types
1️⃣ Compute Savings Plan (MOST FLEXIBLE)

✔ Applies to ANY EC2 instance, any:

Region

Instance family

OS

Size

✔ Covers Fargate + Lambda

📌 Best For:

Multi-region deployments

Changing architectures

Serverless + EC2 mix

2️⃣ EC2 Instance Savings Plan

✔ Applies to specific instance family in a region
(e.g., M5 family in ap-south-1)

✔ You can change:

Instance size (m5.large → m5.xlarge)

OS

Tenancy

📌 Best For:

Stable EC2 workloads

Always using same family

3️⃣ SageMaker Savings Plan

✔ Save up to 64%
✔ Automatically applies to SageMaker usage

Savings Plan Payment Options

(Same as Reserved Instances)

All Upfront

Partial Upfront

No Upfront

⚠ Saving Plans cannot be canceled or refunded.

🟩 3. EC2 Tenancy Models (HIGH EXAM WEIGHT)

Tenancy determines where your EC2 instance runs physically.

1️⃣ Shared Tenancy (Default)

✔ Multiple AWS customers share same physical host
✔ Safest + cheapest
✔ Virtual isolation maintained

📌 Best For:
Almost all workloads

2️⃣ Dedicated Instances

✔ Your instances run on hardware not shared with others
✔ AWS chooses placement
✔ More expensive than shared

📌 Best For:

Compliance workloads

When you need isolation but don’t care about host control

3️⃣ Dedicated Host

✔ Full physical server dedicated to you
✔ You manage placement
✔ Good for Bring Your Own License (BYOL)
✔ Most expensive option

📌 Best For:

Oracle / SQL server licensing

Enterprise compliance restrictions

Host-level visibility needed

Dedicated Host vs Dedicated Instance
Feature	Dedicated Host	Dedicated Instance
You control host	Yes	No
BYOL license support	Yes	Limited
Pricing	Highest	High
Instance placement visibility	Yes	No
🟧 4. Exam-Important Comparisons
🔥 On-Demand vs RI vs Spot vs Savings Plans
Option            	Cost	                Commitment	         Interruptions?	                    Best For
On-Demand         	High	               None	                     No	                         Unpredictable
Reserved Instances	Medium	             1–3 yrs	                 No                        	Steady workloads
Savings Plans	      Medium-Low	         1–3 yrs                  	No	                      Flexible workloads
Spot	              Lowest	             None	                     Yes (2-min warning)	        Batch, big data
🟥 5. Common SAA-C03 Exam Traps

✔ Spot instances = terminated anytime → DO NOT use for DB or stateful services
✔ Tenancy cannot be changed after launch
✔ Compute Savings Plan = MOST flexible
✔ RIs require you to choose instance family & region (unless Convertible RI)
✔ Dedicated Hosts = required for BYOL
✔ Savings Plans apply to EC2, Lambda, Fargate (RIs do NO
