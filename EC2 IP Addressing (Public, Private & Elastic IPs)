1. What Are IP Addresses in AWS VPC?
IP addresses allow resources in your VPC to communicate:
Within the VPC (private communication)
To the internet (public communication)
AWS uses IPv4 by default (IPv6 optional).
When creating a VPC, you must assign a CIDR block
Example: 172.31.0.0/16

2. Private IPv4 Addresses
✔ Not reachable from the internet
Used for internal communication within VPC.
✔ Examples
EC2 ↔ EC2 inside VPC
EC2 ↔ RDS
EC2 in private subnet accessing NAT gateway

✔ Assigned from your VPC/subnet CIDR
Example:
10.0.1.25

✔ Persistent
Stays with EC2 even after stop/start
Lost only when EC2 is terminated

3. Public IPv4 Addresses
✔ Reachable from the internet
Mapped to private IP via NAT (1:1)

Key Facts
Assigned automatically when launching EC2 in public subnet
Taken from AWS public IP pool (NOT your AWS account)
Cannot be manually detached or moved
Changes on every stop/start (not persistent)

4. Elastic IP Address (EIP)
✔ Static, Persistent Public IPv4
Allocated to your AWS account, not to AWS pool.

Why Use Elastic IP?
Need a consistent public IP
Instance replacement/failover scenarios
(move EIP from EC2 #1 → EC2 #2 instantly)

Key Exam Rules
Always IPv4 only
(No Elastic IP for IPv6)
When EIP attaches to EC2:
→ public IPv4 is released automatically
Charged when not attached to a running instance
(To prevent wasting public IPv4 space)

5. IPv4 vs IPv6 (Important Differences)
Feature         	            IPv4	                                       IPv6
VPC CIDR size            	/16 to /28	                               Always /56
Subnet CIDR size	        /16 to /28	                               Always /64
Public/Private distinction	Yes                             	No — all IPv6 are public
Elastic IP supported?	    ✔ Yes	                                          ❌ No
Internet access	Needs       IGW & public IP                       	Needs IGW only

Critical Exam Point
👉 IPv6 = Always public. No private IPv6. No EIP.

6. Internet Access Requirements
For IPv4
Instance needs:
Public IPv4 or EIP
Internet Gateway (IGW)
Route table: 0.0.0.0/0 → IGW

For IPv6
Instance needs:
IPv6 assigned
Internet Gateway
Route: ::/0 → IGW

7. Public IP vs Elastic IP (Side-by-Side)
Feature                         	Public IP	                               Elastic IP
Changes on stop/start         	✔ Yes	                                           ❌ No
Owned by	                       AWS pool	                                      Your account
Can be moved between instances     	❌ No	                                         ✔ Yes
Manual attach/detach               	❌ No	                                          ✔ Yes
Charges when unused?	             ❌ No                                          	✔ Yes

Use case	Basic internet access	Need permanent IP
8. Exam Trick Scenarios
Scenario 1 – Need fixed IP for a web app
→ Use Elastic IP
Scenario 2 – EC2 restarts and gets new IP
→ Because it used Public IP, not EIP

Scenario 3 – IPv6 instance needs static IP
→ IPv6 is ALWAYS static
→ No Elastic IP support

Scenario 4 – Want to assign public IP manually?
→ Cannot. Public IP is AWS-managed.

9. One-Line Definitions (Exam Revision)
Private IP → internal only, no internet
Public IP → internet access, changes on restart
Elastic IP → static public IP, account-owned
IPv6 → always public, no EIP support

10. Ultra Short Summary (Memory Trick)
P – P – E
Private = Private use
Public = Pool from AWS, Poof! Changes on restart
EIP = Eternal (static)
