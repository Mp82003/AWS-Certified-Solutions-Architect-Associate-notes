## ELB Stickiness (Session Affinity) 🔑

### What is Stickiness?

**Definition:** Routes requests from the same client to the same target within a target group to maintain session state

**Target Group Components:**
- EC2 instances serving your application
- Lambda functions serving APIs/microservices  
- Other compute targets

**Session State Requirement:** Used with servers that maintain state information for continuous user experience

### Real-World Use Cases

**Primary Scenarios:**
- **Shopping Cart Applications:** Track items across multiple requests
- **Multi-step Forms:** Maintain form data across pages
- **User Authentication Sessions:** Keep login state consistent
- **File Upload Progress:** Track upload status across requests

**Client Requirements:**
- Client/browser **must support cookies**
- Session tracking via cookie exchange between client and load balancer

### How Stickiness Works - Visual Concept

#### Scenario: E-commerce Shopping Cart

**Without Stickiness (Problem):**
```
User Request 1 → ALB → Server A (adds item to cart)
User Request 2 → ALB → Server B (cart appears empty!)
User Request 3 → ALB → Server A (cart reappears)
Result: Inconsistent user experience
```

**With Stickiness (Solution):**
```
User Request 1 → ALB → Server A (generates AWS ALB cookie)
User Request 2 → ALB → Server A (cookie routes to same server)
User Request 3 → ALB → Server A (session maintained)
Result: Consistent shopping cart experience
```

#### Technical Flow:
1. **First Request:** ALB receives HTTP request, routes to target, generates `AWS ALB` cookie
2. **Cookie Response:** ALB sends cookie back to client with target information
3. **Subsequent Requests:** Client includes cookie, ALB routes to same target
4. **Session Maintenance:** State preserved across entire user journey

### Advanced Stickiness Behaviors

#### Target Failure Handling:
- **Scenario:** Cookie references unhealthy/deregistered target
- **ALB Response:** Automatically selects new healthy target
- **Cookie Update:** Updates cookie with new target information
- **User Impact:** Seamless failover with minimal session disruption

#### Session Duration Management:
- **Configuration:** Set duration in seconds at target group level
- **Renewal Mechanism:** Duration resets with each client request
- **Example:** 1-hour stickiness + client activity = session extends another hour
- **Session Death:** No activity within duration = session expires

#### Duration Best Practices:
- **Short Sessions:** 15-30 minutes for security-sensitive applications
- **Long Sessions:** 1-8 hours for shopping/productivity applications
- **Consider:** Balance between user experience and server resource distribution

### Cookie Technical Details 🍪

#### Primary Stickiness Cookies:
- **Standard Cookie:** `AWS ALB` 
- **CORS Cookie:** `AWS ALB CORS` (cross-origin resource sharing)

#### Security Features:
- **Encryption:** Contents encrypted using rotating keys
- **Immutability:** Cannot decrypt, modify, or tamper with cookies
- **Generation:** Only ALB-generated cookies supported
- **Rotation:** Keys automatically rotated for enhanced security

#### Cookie Headers:
- **Time Attribute:** Uses `expires` attribute (NOT `Max-Age`)
- **CORS Requirements:** Some browsers need `SameSite=None; Secure` header
- **Dual Cookie Response:** CORS environments receive both cookies

#### Unsupported Features:
- **URL Encoding:** ALB does NOT support URL-encoded cookie values
- **Custom Cookies:** Only load balancer-generated cookies work
- **Cookie Modification:** Cannot alter cookie contents client-side

---

## Critical Exam Knowledge ⚠️

### ALB-Specific Stickiness Rules:

#### Cookie Limitations:
- ✅ **Supported:** Only ALB-generated cookies (`AWS ALB`, `AWS ALB CORS`)
- ❌ **Not Supported:** Custom application cookies, URL-encoded values
- 🔒 **Security:** Encrypted with rotating keys, cannot be modified
- 📅 **Headers:** Uses `expires` attribute, NOT `Max-Age` header

#### Multi-Layer ALB Restrictions:
- **Rule:** Can only enable stickiness on ONE layer when using multiple ALBs
- **Reason:** All ALBs use identical cookie names
- **Exam Trap:** Questions about stickiness across ALB tiers

#### Forward Action Requirements:
- **Scenario:** Forward action with multiple target groups
- **Rule:** If ANY target group has stickiness enabled, must enable target group stickiness
- **Configuration:** Target group-level setting required

### WebSocket Special Behavior:

#### Inherent Stickiness:
- **Nature:** WebSocket connections are automatically sticky
- **Upgrade Process:** Target returning HTTP 101 status becomes permanent target
- **Post-Upgrade:** Cookie-based stickiness becomes irrelevant
- **Exam Point:** WebSockets have built-in session affinity

### Common Exam Trap Scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: URL-Encoded Cookies
```
Question: "Why isn't stickiness working with URL-encoded cookie values?"
Answer: ALB does not support URL-encoded cookie values
```

#### Scenario 2: Multi-Layer ALB Stickiness
```
Question: "Can you enable stickiness on both ALB layers?"
Answer: No, only one layer due to identical cookie naming
```

#### Scenario 3: Custom Cookie Integration
```
Question: "How to use application-generated session cookies with ALB?"
Answer: Cannot use custom cookies, only ALB-generated cookies supported
```

#### Scenario 4: WebSocket + Stickiness
```
Question: "Do you need to configure stickiness for WebSocket applications?"
Answer: No, WebSocket connections are inherently sticky after upgrade
```

## Application Load Balancer Deep Dive

### Core Concepts

#### ALB Architecture:
- **Single Point of Contact:** Clients connect to one ALB endpoint
- **Multi-AZ Requirement:** Must deploy across at least 2 Availability Zones
- **Traffic Distribution:** Spreads requests across targets in multiple AZs
- **High Availability:** Increases application availability through redundancy

#### Key Components:

**1. Listeners**
- Listen on defined ports and protocols
- Evaluate requests against routing rules
- Forward traffic based on rule matches
- Must have at least one default action

**2. Rules**
- Have priority order (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Include one or more conditions (path, host, headers)
- Include one or more actions (forward, redirect, authenticate)
- Default rule catches unmatched requests

**3. Target Groups**
- Logical grouping of targets (EC2, containers, Lambda, IP)
- Health checks performed per target group
- Routing algorithms: Round Robin (default) or Least Outstanding Requests
- Targets can belong to multiple target groups

### ALB Request Processing Flow:
```
1. Client Request → ALB
2. Listener evaluates rules by priority
3. Rule condition matches → Action executes
4. Target selected from target group
5. Request forwarded to healthy target
6. Response returned to client
```

---

## Advanced ALB Features & Routing

### Path-Based Routing 🛣️
**Example Scenario:**
- `/api/*` → API Target Group (microservices)
- `/images/*` → Static Content Target Group 
- `/videos/*` → Video Processing Target Group
- `/*` → Default Web Target Group

**Exam Pattern:** Questions about routing different URL paths to different services

### Host-Based Routing
**Example Scenario:**
- `api.example.com` → API Target Group
- `www.example.com` → Web Target Group
- `admin.example.com` → Admin Target Group

### Routing Algorithms:
1. **Round Robin (Default):** Distributes requests evenly across targets
2. **Least Outstanding Requests:** Routes to target with fewest active requests

---

## Critical ALB Integrations for Exam

### 1. ALB + Route 53 Health Checks
- **Active/Passive Failover:** Route 53 can failover between ALBs
- **Health Check Integration:** Route 53 monitors ALB health
- **Multi-Region Setup:** Primary region ALB fails → backup region ALB

### 2. ALB as CloudFront Origin
- **Architecture:** CloudFront → ALB → Target Groups
- **Benefits:** Global content distribution, caching, DDoS protection
- **Use Cases:** Global web applications, API acceleration

### 3. ALB + AWS Global Accelerator ⚡
**What is Global Accelerator:**
- Improves performance for local and global users
- Uses AWS Global Network (faster than public internet)
- Provides static IP addresses for applications

**Two Types:**
1. **Standard Accelerator:** 
   - Routes traffic to optimal regional endpoint
   - Based on health, client location, policies
   - Endpoints: NLB, ALB, EC2, Elastic IP

2. **Custom Routing Accelerator:**
   - Maps users to specific destinations
   - More granular traffic control

**ALB Integration:**
- ALB can be Global Accelerator endpoint
- Provides static IPs and improved performance
- Instant reaction to health/configuration changes

### 4. ALB vs NLB Decision Matrix 📊

| Scenario | Choose ALB | Choose NLB |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Protocol | HTTP/HTTPS | TCP/TLS/UDP |
| Routing Needs | Path/Host-based | Connection-based |
| Performance | Standard web apps | Ultra-high performance |
| IP Requirements | Dynamic | Static IP needed |
| Use Cases | Web apps, APIs, microservices | Gaming, IoT, real-time apps |

### 5. ALB + ECS Fargate
**Architecture:** ALB → ECS Service → Fargate Tasks
- **Dynamic Port Mapping:** ALB routes to dynamic container ports
- **Service Discovery:** Automatic registration/deregistration
- **Health Checks:** Container-level health monitoring
- **Scaling Integration:** Works with ECS auto-scaling

---

## Session Management Strategies

### 1. Sticky Sessions (Session Cookies)
- **How:** ALB generates session cookies
- **Pros:** Simple to implement
- **Cons:** Session lost if target becomes unhealthy
- **Use Cases:** Simple applications with server-side state

### 2. ElastiCache for Session Management ⭐ PREFERRED
**Architecture:**
```
Client → ALB → EC2/Fargate → ElastiCache Redis
```

**Process Flow:**
1. User login → Target validates credentials
2. Target creates session in ElastiCache Redis
3. Returns session cookie to client
4. Subsequent requests use cookie
5. Any target can retrieve session from ElastiCache

**Benefits:**
- **Resilient:** Session survives target failures
- **Scalable:** Supports multiple target groups
- **Flexible:** Easy to add/remove targets
- **Performance:** Fast Redis lookups

**Exam Pattern:** Compare sticky sessions vs ElastiCache scenarios

---

export ALBDNS="my-alb-xxxxxxxxx.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
```

**Exam Tip:** Understanding environment variables shows advanced CLI knowledge

---

## Step-by-Step CLI Implementation

### Phase 1: Security Group Creation

#### Create Security Group:
```bash
aws ec2 create-security-group \
    --group-name "ALB-Security-Group" \
    --description "Security group for ALB lab" \
    --vpc-id $VPC
```

#### Configure Security Group Rules:
```bash
# SSH access from your IP only
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
    --group-id $SGID \
    --protocol tcp \
    --port 22 \
    --cidr $IPADD/32

# HTTP access from anywhere
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
    --group-id $SGID \
    --protocol tcp \
    --port 80 \
    --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

**Exam Focus:** Security group configuration for ALB access patterns

### Phase 2: Subnet Creation

#### Subnet Requirements:
- **Minimum 2 AZs:** ALB requirement
- **Different CIDR blocks:** Non-overlapping IP ranges
- **Upper IP ranges:** Avoid conflicts with existing subnets

```bash
# Subnet 1 - AZ1
aws ec2 create-subnet \
    --vpc-id $VPC \
    --availability-zone us-east-1a \
    --cidr-block 172.31.128.0/20

# Subnet 2 - AZ2  
aws ec2 create-subnet \
    --vpc-id $VPC \
    --availability-zone us-east-1b \
    --cidr-block 172.31.192.0/20
```

**Exam Tip:** Remember ALB requires minimum 2 AZs with separate subnets

### Phase 3: EC2 Instance Creation

#### Key Parameters:
- **AMI:** Amazon Linux 2 (free tier)
- **Instance Type:** t2.micro (free tier)
- **Public IP:** Required for internet access
- **User Data:** Automated web server setup

    --key-name ALB-KeyPair \
    --security-group-ids $SGID \
    --subnet-id $AZ1SUB \
    --associate-public-ip-address \
    --user-data file://user-data-video-server-1.txt
```

**Exam Pattern:** Questions about user data automation and instance configuration

### Phase 4: Application Load Balancer Creation

```bash
aws elbv2 create-load-balancer \
    --name "My-ALB" \
    --subnets $AZ1SUB $AZ2SUB \
    --security-groups $SGID
```

**Key Points:**
- **Multi-AZ deployment:** Uses both subnets
- **Security group attachment:** Same SG as instances
- **DNS name generation:** Automatic ALB endpoint creation

### Phase 5: Target Group Configuration

#### Create Target Groups:
```bash
# Video Target Group
aws elbv2 create-target-group \
    --name "video-targets" \
    --protocol HTTP \
    --port 80 \
    --vpc-id $VPC

# Web Target Group  
aws elbv2 create-target-group \
    --name "web-targets" \
    --protocol HTTP \
    --port 80 \
    --vpc-id $VPC
```

#### Register Targets:
```bash
# Register video servers
aws elbv2 register-targets \
    --target-group-arn $VIDEOTG \
    --targets Id=$VIDEOSERVER1 Id=$VIDEOSERVER2

# Register web servers
aws elbv2 register-targets \
    --target-group-arn $WEBTG \
    --targets Id=$WEBSERVER1 Id=$WEBSERVER2
```

**Exam Focus:** Understanding target registration and health checks

### Phase 6: Listener and Rules Configuration

#### Create Default Listener:
```bash
aws elbv2 create-listener \
    --load-balancer-arn $ALBORN \
    --protocol HTTP \
    --port 80 \
    --default-actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=$WEBTG
```

#### Create Path-Based Routing Rule:
```bash
aws elbv2 create-rule \
    --listener-arn $LISTENERARN \
    --priority 5 \
    --conditions file://conditions-pattern.json \
    --actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=$VIDEOTG
```

#### Conditions Pattern File:
```json
[
  {
    "Field": "path-pattern",
    "PathPatternConfig": {
      "Values": ["vid/*"]
    }
  }
]
```

**Exam Tip:** Lower priority numbers = higher priority (priority 1 > priority 5)

---

## Testing & Validation

### Expected Behavior:

#### Default Route (Web Target Group):
- **URL:** `http://[ALB-DNS-NAME]`
- **Result:** Alternates between Orange (Web Server 1) and Blue (Web Server 2)
- **Round Robin:** Default load balancing algorithm

#### Path-Based Route (Video Target Group):
- **URL:** `http://[ALB-DNS-NAME]/vid/`
- **Result:** Alternates between Red (Video Server 1) and Green (Video Server 2)
- **Path Pattern:** `/vid/*` matches `/vid/` and `/vid/anything`

### Health Check Validation:
```bash
# Check target group health
aws elbv2 describe-target-health \
    --target-group-arn $VIDEOTG

aws elbv2 describe-target-health \
    --target-group-arn $WEBTG
```

**States:**
- **healthy:** Target passing health checks
- **unhealthy:** Target failing health checks  
- **unused:** Target group not receiving traffic
- **initial:** Target registration in progress

---

## Cleanup Process (Critical for Cost Management)

### Proper Deletion Order:
```bash
# 1. Delete custom rules first
aws elbv2 delete-rule --rule-arn $VIDEORULE

# 2. Delete listener (removes default rule)
aws elbv2 delete-listener --listener-arn $LISTENERARN

# 3. Delete target groups
aws elbv2 delete-target-group --target-group-arn $VIDEOTG
aws elbv2 delete-target-group --target-group-arn $WEBTG

# 4. Delete load balancer
aws elbv2 delete-load-balancer --load-balancer-arn $ALBORN

# 5. Terminate EC2 instances
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids $VIDEOSERVER1 $VIDEOSERVER2 $WEBSERVER1 $WEBSERVER2

# 6. Delete subnets (wait for instances to terminate)
aws ec2 delete-subnet --subnet-id $AZ1SUB
aws ec2 delete-subnet --subnet-id $AZ2SUB

# 7. Delete security group
aws ec2 delete-security-group --group-id $SGID
```

**Exam Warning:** Dependency order matters - deleting in wrong order causes errors

## Exam-Relevant CLI Knowledge

### High-Probability Command Patterns:

#### ALB Creation Questions:
- **Subnets requirement:** Must specify multiple AZs
- **Security groups:** ALB needs appropriate ingress rules
- **DNS naming:** AWS automatically generates DNS names

#### Target Group Questions:
- **Health checks:** Default HTTP health checks on port 80
- **Registration:** Targets must be registered to receive traffic
- **Multi-group membership:** Instances can belong to multiple target groups

#### Listener Rules Questions:
- **Priority order:** Lower numbers = higher priority
- **Default actions:** Every listener needs default action
- **Conditions:** Path patterns, host headers, HTTP methods

### CLI vs Console Differences:

| Task | CLI Advantage | Console Advantage |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| **Automation** | Scriptable, repeatable | Visual workflow |
| **Speed** | Faster for bulk operations | Easier for beginners |
| **Exam** | More detailed questions | Basic concept questions |
| **Real World** | Infrastructure as Code | Quick prototyping |

## Common Exam Question Patterns

### 1. Architecture Design (30%)
**Pattern:** "Design ALB architecture for [scenario]"
- **Key Elements:** Multi-AZ, target groups, path routing
- **Answer Focus:** Security groups, subnets, listener rules

### 2. Troubleshooting (25%)
**Pattern:** "ALB not working, what's wrong?"
- **Common Issues:** Wrong security groups, single AZ, unhealthy targets
- **Solution Path:** Check health, verify rules, confirm subnets

### 3. Path-Based Routing (20%)
**Pattern:** "Route /api to API servers, /web to web servers"
- **Implementation:** Multiple target groups with listener rules
- **Priority:** Remember lower numbers = higher priority

### 4. CLI Implementation (15%)
**Pattern:** "Create ALB using CLI commands"
- **Key Commands:** create-load-balancer, create-target-group, create-listener
- **Dependencies:** Subnets → ALB → Target Groups → Listeners → Rules

### 5. Cost Optimization (10%)
**Pattern:** "How to minimize ALB costs?"
- **Solutions:** Proper cleanup, right-sizing, resource sharing

## Memory Aids for Exam

### ALB Creation Sequence:
**"SSALT"** - **S**ecurity group, **S**ubnets, **A**LB, **L**istener, **T**argets

### Path Pattern Memory:
- **Default rule:** Catches everything not matched
- **Custom rules:** Need specific path patterns
- **Priority logic:** 1 beats 5 beats 10 beats default

### Health Check States:
- **healthy** = green light, receives traffic
- **unhealthy** = red light, no traffic  
- **unused** = target group exists but no rules point to it
- **initial** = starting up, be patient

## Quick Reference Commands

### Essential ALB CLI Commands:
```bash
# Create ALB
aws elbv2 create-load-balancer

# Create target group  
aws elbv2 create-target-group

# Register targets
aws elbv2 register-targets

# Create listener
aws elbv2 create-listener

# Create rule
aws elbv2 create-rule

# Check health
aws elbv2 describe-target-health
```

### Key Environment Variables:
```bash
export VPC="vpc-id"
export SGID="sg-id"  
export ALBORN="alb-arn"
export TARGETGROUPARN="tg-arn"
export LISTENERARN="listener-arn"
```

## Final Exam Checklist

### Must Remember:
- [ ] ALB requires minimum 2 AZs with separate subnets
- [ ] Security groups need HTTP (80) and SSH (22) rules
- [ ] Default listener rule catches unmatched requests
- [ ] Lower priority numbers evaluated first
- [ ] Target health states: healthy, unhealthy, unused, initial
- [ ] Path patterns use wildcards: `/api/*`, `/vid/*`
- [ ] Environment variables simplify CLI workflows
- [ ] Proper cleanup order prevents deletion errors

### CLI Command Priorities:
- **High:** create-load-balancer, create-target-group, create-listener
- **Medium:** register-targets, create-rule, describe-target-health
- **Low:** delete commands, describe commands

**Study Time Recommendation:** 60-90 minutes for hands-on understanding
