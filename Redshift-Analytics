# AWS Solutions Architect - Amazon Redshift Study Notes

## Overview
**Amazon Redshift** is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service designed for fast querying and analysis of large datasets using SQL queries.

## Key Characteristics
### Core Features
- **Fully Managed Service**: AWS handles maintenance, backups, and scaling
- **Petabyte Scale**: Can handle massive amounts of data
- **SQL-Based**: Uses standard SQL queries for analysis
- **Highly Scalable**: Easily scale data warehouse as data grows
- **Based on PostgreSQL**: Compatible with most SQL client applications with minimal code changes

## Architecture Components
### 1. Client Applications
Integration with various tools:
- **ETL Tools** (Extract, Transform, Load)
- **Business Intelligence (BI) Reporting Tools**
- **Data Mining Tools**
- **Analytics Tools**

### 2. Cluster
**Core infrastructure component** containing:
- One or more compute nodes
- One leader node per cluster

### 3. Leader Node
**Responsibilities:**
- Coordinates communication between client applications and compute nodes
- Develops execution plans for queries
- Distributes tasks to compute nodes
- Handles SQL statements
- Manages certain functions while compute nodes execute code
- Aggregates results from compute nodes

### 4. Compute Nodes
**Functions:**
- Execute tasks assigned by leader node
- Send intermediate results back for aggregation
- Each node has dedicated CPU and memory
- Can scale by increasing node count or upgrading node type

### 5. Storage

#### Redshift Managed Storage (RMS)
- Data stored in separate storage tier
- Scales storage to petabytes using **Amazon S3**
- Allows independent scaling of compute and storage
- Automatically uses high-performance **SSD-based local storage** as Tier 1 cache
- Optimizations include:
  - Data block temperature
  - Data blockage
  - Workload patterns
- Automatically scales to S3 without user intervention

#### Database
- Cluster can contain one or more databases
- User data stored on compute nodes
- SQL clients communicate with leader node
- RDBMS compatible with other database applications
- Optimized for high-performance analysis and reporting (not OLTP)

### 6. Node Slices
- Compute nodes partitioned into slices
- Each slice allocated portion of node's memory and disk space
- Processes portion of assigned workload
- Leader node manages data distribution to slices
- Slices work in **parallel** to complete operations
- Number of slices determined by node size
- Distribution keys determine data distribution for efficient query processing

### 7. Internal Network
- High bandwidth connections
- Close proximity architecture
- Custom communication protocols
- Private, high-speed network between leader and compute nodes
- Compute nodes run on **isolated network** (no client access)
