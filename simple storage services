### 2. Object
- Basic storage entity in S3
- Size range: **0 bytes to 5 TB**
- Can be any type of file (text, images, videos, application data)

### 3. Key
- Unique identifier for an object within a bucket
- Used to retrieve objects
- **Bucket name + Key = S3 URL** (unique identifier)

### 4. Metadata
- Additional information about objects
- Includes content type, creation date, custom metadata

## Access Control

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Manage access to buckets and objects
- Include permissions for:
  - Owner
  - Authenticated AWS users
  - Public access

### Bucket Policies
- **JSON-based policies** attached to S3 buckets
- Define permissions and access control rules
- Can specify conditions for allowing/denying access

### Other Access Methods
- AWS IAM policies
- S3 access points

## Storage Classes (Critical for Exam)

### 1. S3 Standard (Default)
- **Use Case**: Frequently accessed data
- **Characteristics**: Durable, low latency
- **Best For**: Active data, websites, content distribution

### 2. S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)
- **Use Case**: Infrequently accessed data
- **Characteristics**: Lower storage cost than Standard, same performance
- **Best For**: Backups, disaster recovery, long-term storage

### 3. S3 One Zone-IA
- **Use Case**: Infrequently accessed, non-critical data
- **Characteristics**: Single AZ storage, lower cost than Standard-IA
- **Best For**: Data that can be easily recreated
- **Trade-off**: Slightly less durability

### 4. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- **Use Case**: Data with unknown/changing access patterns
- **Characteristics**: Automatically moves objects between frequent and infrequent access tiers
- **Best For**: Unpredictable access patterns

### 5. S3 Glacier Storage Classes

#### S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
- **Use Case**: Long-lived, rarely accessed data
- **Retrieval Time**: Milliseconds

- **Scope**: Define permissions for entire buckets
- **Use Case**: Grant cross-account access, public access policies

### 2. Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- **Scope**: Can be applied at both bucket AND object levels
- **Granularity**: More granular than bucket policies
- **Legacy**: Older method, bucket policies preferred for most use cases

### 3. IAM Integration
- **Purpose**: Manage access to AWS services and resources securely
- **Application**: Use IAM policies to control S3 bucket and object access
- **Best Practice**: Combine with bucket policies for comprehensive security

### 4. Encryption Options

#### Server-Side Encryption (SSE)
- **SSE-S3**: Amazon S3 managed keys
- **SSE-KMS**: AWS Key Management Service
- **SSE-C**: Customer-provided keys

#### Encryption Scope
- **Data at Rest**: Server-side encryption
- **Data in Transit**: HTTPS/SSL encryption

### 5. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Delete
- **Purpose**: Extra security layer for object deletion
- **Requirement**: MFA device authentication before deletion
- **Use Case**: Protect critical data from accidental deletion

## S3 Versioning (Critical for Exam)

### Key Concepts
- **Feature**: Keep multiple versions of objects in same bucket
- **Protection**: Guards against accidental deletion/overwriting
- **Enable**: At bucket level only

### Important Rules
1. **Cannot be Disabled**: Once enabled, can only be **suspended**
2. **Unique Version ID**: Every object gets a unique version identifier
3. **Bucket-Wide**: Applies to all objects in the bucket

### Delete Behavior
- **Soft Delete**: Objects don't actually get deleted
- **Delete Marker**: Added to indicate "deleted" status
- **Latest Version**: One without delete marker
- **Recovery**: Delete the delete marker to restore object
- **Audit Trail**: Can list all versions for auditing and recovery

### Exam Tips for Versioning
- Understand the difference between delete and suspend
- Know that storage costs increase with multiple versions
- Remember that you pay for all versions stored

## S3 Replication

### Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
- **Purpose**: Replicate objects across different AWS regions
- **Benefits**: 
  - Data redundancy
  - Disaster recovery
  - Low-latency access from different geographic locations

### Same-Region Replication (SRR)
- **Purpose**: Replication within the same region
- **Use Cases**: Compliance, log aggregation, replication between accounts

### Key Characteristics
- **Asynchronous**: Delay between source and destination updates
- **Monitoring**: Use CloudWatch metrics and S3 access logs
- **Acceleration**: Optional S3 Transfer Acceleration for faster uploads
- **Versioning Required**: Both source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled

### Replication Requirements
- Source bucket must have versioning enabled
- Destination bucket must have versioning enabled
- Appropriate IAM permissions must be configured
- Objects existing before replication setup are NOT replicated automatically

## S3 Billing & Cost Factors (Important for Exam)

### 1. Storage Costs
- **Variable Pricing**: Based on storage class chosen
- **Cost Hierarchy**: Standard > Standard-IA > One Zone-IA > Intelligent-Tiering > Glacier classes
- **Usage-Based**: Pay for actual data stored

### 2. Data Transfer Costs
- **Inbound**: Generally free (data transfer INTO S3)
- **Outbound**: Charged (data transfer OUT of S3)
- **Inter-Region**: Charges for data transfer between regions
- **Intra-Region**: Charges for transfers between S3 buckets in same region
- **Internet**: Charges for data transfer to external networks

### 3. Request Costs
- **GET Requests**: Charged per request
- **PUT Requests**: Charged per request
- **Different Rates**: Vary by storage class

### 4. Feature-Specific Costs
- **Versioning**: Pay for storage of all versions
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Additional storage and transfer costs
- **S3 Transfer Acceleration**: Additional charges for faster uploads
- **Lifecycle Transitions**: Small fees for transitioning between storage classes

## Cost Optimization Strategies (Exam Focus)

### 1. Storage Class Selection
- Choose appropriate storage class based on access patterns
- Use Intelligent-Tiering for unpredictable patterns
- Implement lifecycle policies for automatic transitions

### 2. Data Transfer Optimization
