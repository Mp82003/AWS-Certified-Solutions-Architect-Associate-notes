## Overview
**AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)** is a cloud-based security service that protects web applications and APIs from common web exploits that can:
- Affect application availability
- Compromise security
- Consume excessive resources

## Key Services Integration
AWS WAF works with these AWS services (EXAM IMPORTANT):
- **Amazon CloudFront** distributions
- **Application Load Balancers (ALB)**
- **Amazon API Gateway**
- **AWS AppSync** GraphQL APIs

## Core Features

### 1. Customizable Web Security Rules
- Create custom rules and combine into **rule groups**
- Rule groups are **reusable** across multiple applications
- Rules based on:
  - IP addresses
  - HTTP headers
  - URI strings
  - SQL injection attempts
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

### 2. Real-time Visibility and Monitoring
- Detailed logs for allowed, blocked, or counted requests
- Log destinations:
  - **Amazon CloudWatch Logs**
  - **Amazon S3**
  - **Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose**

### 3. Bot Control
- Identify and manage automated bot traffic
- Create rules to block/allow specific bots
- Limit bot impact on applications

### 4. Rate Limiting
- **Rate-based rules** automatically block/throttle traffic
- Based on requests per time period from specific IP addresses
- Helps prevent DDoS attacks

### 5. Geographic Restrictions (Geo-blocking)
- Allow or block traffic from specific countries/regions
- Based on geographic location of incoming requests

## How AWS WAF Works

### Request Processing Flow:
1. **Request Inspection** - WAF inspects incoming requests
2. **Rule Evaluation** - Rules processed in priority order (top to bottom)
3. **Action Execution** - First matching rule determines action
4. **Logging** - All evaluations logged to chosen destination

### Rule Actions:
- **Allow** - Permit the request
- **Block** - Deny the request (can return custom HTTP response)
- **Count** - Log the request but don't block (useful for testing)

## Common Use Cases (Exam Scenarios)

### 1. Protection Against Web Attacks
- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection
- DDoS attack mitigation

### 2. API Security
- Filter malicious requests to APIs
- Ensure only valid requests reach backend services

### 3. Compliance and Security Posture
- Meet compliance requirements
- Improve overall security posture

## Best Practices (Exam Important)

### 1. Testing and Deployment
- **Test rules in staging environment first**
- **Use COUNT mode initially** to identify false positives
- Gradually move to BLOCK mode after validation

### 2. Rule Management
- **Regular rule evaluation and updates**
- Use AWS Managed Rules Groups to reduce maintenance
- Leverage AWS WAF logs for analysis

### 3. Integration
- Develop incident response plans including WAF
- Train teams on WAF rule adjustments
- Use tools like Amazon Athena or OpenSearch for log analysis

## Limitations (Exam Awareness)

### 1. Complexity
- Managing numerous rules for large applications can be complex
- Requires careful planning and organization

### 2. Learning Curve
- New users may need time to master configuration
- Optimization requires experience

### 3. Cost Considerations
- Extensive custom rules can increase costs
- Frequent rule evaluations add to expenses
- Balance security needs with cost management

## Exam Tips

### Key Points to Remember:
- **WAF placement**: Works with CloudFront, ALB, API Gateway, AppSync
- **Rule evaluation**: Top-to-bottom priority, stops at first match
- **Testing approach**: Always use COUNT mode before BLOCK mode
- **Geographic blocking**: Available for country/region-based restrictions
- **Rate limiting**: Automatic blocking based on request frequency
- **Managed rules**: AWS provides pre-configured rule groups

### Common Exam Scenarios:
1. **DDoS Protection**: Use rate-based rules + CloudFront integration
2. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Custom rules or managed rule groups
3. **Geographic Restrictions**: Geo-blocking for compliance requirements
4. **API Protection**: Integration with API Gateway for REST API security
5. **Bot Management**: Automated bot detection and control

### Integration Patterns:
- **CloudFront + WAF**: Global web application protection
- **ALB + WAF**: Regional application protection
- **API Gateway + WAF**: API-specific security controls
- **Multi-layer approach**: Combine with Security Groups, NACLs, and Shield

## Cost Optimization
- Use AWS Managed Rules where possible
- Monitor rule evaluation metrics
- Optimize rule ordering for efficiency
- Regular review and cleanup of unused rules
