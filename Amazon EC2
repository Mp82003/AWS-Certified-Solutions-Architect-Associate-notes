| **Persistence** | Ephemeral (data lost on stop/terminate) | Persistent (survives stop/terminate) |
| **Performance** | Very High (physically attached) | High (network attached) |
| **Cost** | Included in instance cost | Separate charges apply |
| **Backup** | Manual backup required | Snapshots available |
| **Durability** | Low (tied to instance lifecycle) | High (replicated within AZ) |
| **Resizing** | Fixed at launch | Can be resized |
| **Encryption** | Manual encryption only | Built-in encryption available |
| **Use Case** | Temporary, high-performance storage | Boot volumes, databases, persistent data |

---

# AWS VPC IP Addressing - Solution Architect Associate Notes

## Overview of IP Addressing in VPC

**Purpose:** Enable communication between VPC resources and with internet/AWS services

**Architecture Components:**
- VPC with CIDR blocks
- Public and Private subnets  
- Internet Gateway for internet access
- Route 53 for DNS resolution
- EC2 instances with different IP addressing

---

## IP Address Types in AWS

### 1. Private IP Addresses
**Characteristics:**
- **Not internet routable** - cannot be accessed from internet
- **Used for internal communication** within VPC
- **Always assigned** to every EC2 instance
- **Persistent** throughout instance lifecycle
- **Free** - no additional charges

**CIDR Ranges (RFC 1918):**
- 10.0.0.0/8 (10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255)
- 172.16.0.0/12 (172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255)
- 192.168.0.0/16 (192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255)

### 2. Public IP Addresses
**Characteristics:**
- **Internet routable** - accessible from internet
- **Dynamic** - changes on instance restart
- **Assigned from Amazon's pool** - not tied to your account
- **Cannot manually associate/disassociate**
- **Free** - no additional charges
- **Released on instance stop/terminate**

**Assignment Methods:**
- Subnet-level: Enable "Auto-assign public IPv4 address"
- Instance-level: Override subnet setting during launch

### 3. Elastic IP Addresses (EIP)
**Characteristics:**
- **Static** - persistent across instance lifecycle
- **Reassignable** - can move between instances
- **Associated with your account** - you own it
- **Manually managed** - full control over assignment
- **Charged when not in use** - hourly billing for unused EIPs
- **IPv4 only** - not supported for IPv6

---

## IPv4 vs IPv6 Comparison

| Feature | IPv4 | IPv6 |
|---------|------|------|
| **VPC CIDR Size** | /16 to /28 | Fixed at /56 |
| **Subnet CIDR Size** | /16 to /28 | Fixed at /64 |
| **Public vs Private** | Distinction exists | All addresses are public |
| **Internet Access** | NAT required for private | Direct internet access |
| **Elastic IP Support** | ✅ Supported | ❌ Not supported |
| **Address Format** | 32-bit (4 octets) | 128-bit (8 groups) |
| **Example** | 192.168.1.1 | 2001:db8::1 |

### Key IPv6 Facts for Exam:
- **All IPv6 addresses are public** (no private concept)
- **Elastic IPs not supported** for IPv6
- **Globally unique** and internet routable
- **Dual-stack** operation possible (IPv4 + IPv6)

---

## Elastic IP Deep Dive

### When to Use Elastic IPs:
- **Persistent addressing** requirements
- **Failover scenarios** - reassign to backup instance
- **Domain name mapping** - consistent DNS records
- **Application licensing** tied to IP address
- **Third-party integrations** requiring static IPs

### Elastic IP Behavior:
1. **Assignment:** Replaces public IPv4 address
2. **Release:** Public IPv4 returns to Amazon pool
3. **Reassignment:** Can move to different instance instantly
4. **Termination:** EIP remains in your account for reuse

### Cost Considerations:
- **Free when associated** with running instance
- **Charged hourly when unassociated** ($0.005/hour in most regions)
- **Additional charges** for remapping (frequent reassignment)
- **Release unused EIPs** to avoid charges

---

## Subnet Types and IP Assignment

### Public Subnet
**Characteristics:**
- Route to Internet Gateway (0.0.0.0/0)
- Instances can have public IP addresses
- Internet accessible when properly configured

**Requirements for Internet Access:**
- Internet Gateway attached to VPC
- Route to IGW in route table
- Public IP or Elastic IP assigned
- Security groups allow traffic
- NACLs allow traffic

### Private Subnet
**Characteristics:**
- No direct route to Internet Gateway
- Only private IP addresses assigned
- Internet access via NAT Gateway/Instance

**Use Cases:**
- Database servers
- Application servers
- Internal services
- Backend processing

---

## Configuration Examples

### Example 1: Web Application Architecture
```
VPC CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16

Public Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
- Web servers with public IPs
- Load balancers
- Bastion hosts

Private Subnet: 10.0.2.0/24  
- Database servers (private IPs only)
- Application servers
- Internal services
```

### Example 2: High Availability Setup
```
Region: us-east-1

AZ-1a:
- Public Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
- Private Subnet: 10.0.3.0/24

AZ-1b:
- Public Subnet: 10.0.2.0/24  
- Private Subnet: 10.0.4.0/24
```

---

## Common Exam Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Persistent IP Requirement
**Question:** Web application needs consistent IP for third-party API integration
**Answer:** Use Elastic IP address for static, persistent addressing

### Scenario 2: Instance Restart IP Change
**Question:** Public IP changes after instance restart, breaking connections
**Answer:** Replace public IP with Elastic IP for persistence

### Scenario 3: Private Instance Internet Access  
**Question:** Database server needs internet access for updates but shouldn't be publicly accessible
**Answer:** Place in private subnet with NAT Gateway for outbound internet access

### Scenario 4: Cost Optimization
**Question:** High charges for unused Elastic IPs
**Answer:** Release unused Elastic IPs or associate them with running instances

### Scenario 5: IPv6 Elastic IP Request
**Question:** Need elastic IP for IPv6 instance
**Answer:** Not supported - IPv6 addresses are persistent by default, no elastic IP needed

---

## Security Considerations

### Public IP Security:
- **Security Groups:** Control inbound/outbound traffic
- **NACLs:** Subnet-level traffic filtering  
- **Route Tables:** Control traffic routing
- **Internet Gateway:** Required for internet access

### Private IP Security:
- **Internal communication only** by default
- **NAT for outbound** internet access
- **VPC Peering** for cross-VPC communication
- **VPN/Direct Connect** for on-premises access

### Elastic IP Security:
- **Same security rules apply** as public IPs
- **Monitor reassignment** for security compliance
- **Use CloudTrail** to track EIP changes
- **Consider IP whitelisting** implications

---

## Best Practices

### IP Address Management:
- **Plan CIDR blocks** carefully - cannot be changed
- **Reserve IP ranges** for future expansion
- **Use consistent subnetting** across environments
- **Document IP assignments** for troubleshooting

### Public IP Usage:
- **Use load balancers** instead of direct public IPs when possible
- **Minimize public IP exposure** - principle of least privilege
- **Consider security implications** of public addressing

### Elastic IP Management:
- **Release unused EIPs** to avoid charges
- **Automate EIP management** with Lambda/CloudFormation
- **Monitor EIP usage** with CloudWatch/Cost Explorer
- **Plan for EIP limits** (5 per region by default)

### Cost Optimization:
- **Use public IPs** for non-persistent requirements
- **Reserve EIPs only** when necessary
- **Implement EIP cleanup** procedures
- **Monitor costs** with AWS Cost Explorer

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Cannot Access Instance from Internet:
1. Check if instance has public IP or EIP
2. Verify Internet Gateway is attached
3. Check route table for IGW route
4. Review security group rules
5. Check NACL rules

### Public IP Changes After Restart:
1. **Expected behavior** for public IPs
2. **Solution:** Use Elastic IP for persistence
3. **Alternative:** Use Load Balancer with static endpoint

### High Elastic IP Charges:
1. **Identify unused EIPs** in console/CLI
2. **Release unneeded EIPs** immediately  
3. **Associate EIPs** with running instances
4. **Set up billing alerts** for EIP costs

### IPv6 Connectivity Issues:
1. **Verify IPv6 CIDR** assigned to VPC and subnet
2. **Check route table** for IPv6 routes
3. **Review security groups** for IPv6 rules
4. **Ensure dual-stack configuration** if needed

---

## Key Exam Points

### Critical Facts to Remember:
- **Public IPs change** on instance restart
- **Elastic IPs are static** and reassignable
- **IPv6 addresses are all public** - no private concept
- **Elastic IPs not supported** for IPv6
- **Charged for unused** Elastic IPs
- **Public IPs from Amazon's pool** - not your account

### Common Exam Traps:
- **Converting public IP to elastic IP** - not possible, must replace
- **IPv6 elastic IP** - doesn't exist
- **Private IPv6** - all IPv6 addresses are public
- **Free Elastic IP** - only when associated with running instance

### Scenario Decision Matrix:
- **Need persistence?** → Elastic IP
- **Temporary/cost-sensitive?** → Public IP  
- **Internal communication?** → Private IP only
- **IPv6 requirement?** → No elastic IP option available
- **Failover capability?** → Elastic IP for reassignment
