🚀 1. What Are Step Functions?
AWS Step Functions is a serverless orchestration service that lets you combine Lambda + other AWS services into workflows called state machines.
Think of Step Functions = AWS ka “workflow brain”
It tells AWS services what to do → in what order → with what conditions.

🧩 2. Core Components
State Machine
A workflow made of multiple steps.
Defined using Amazon States Language (ASL) — JSON-based.
Execution
Each run of the workflow = Execution.
States (Very Important for Exam)
State Type	Purpose
Task	Calls Lambda / AWS services
Choice	If-else logic
Pass	Pass input to output, inject static data
Wait	Delay for seconds / until timestamp
Succeed	End workflow successfully
Fail	End workflow with failure
Parallel	Run states in parallel
Map	Run the same step for items dynamically (dynamic parallelism)
Transitions

Use "Next" field → decide next state.
Terminal states → "End": true, "Succeed", "Fail".

🔥 3. Workflow Types
A. Standard Workflows
At-most once execution
Can run up to 1 year
Execution history visible
Use case: long-running, auditable workflows

Performance Limits
Executions: 2,000/sec
Transitions: 4,000/sec
Pricing: per state transition

B. Express Workflows
At-least once execution
Run up to 5 minutes
Execution history → CloudWatch Logs
Use case: high-volume, fast workflows
(IoT, streaming, EMR job trigger, real-time event processing)

Performance
Executions: 100,000/sec
Transitions: nearly unlimited
Pricing: execution count + duration

⚡ 4. Express Workflow Types
Type	API Call	Behavior
Synchronous	StartSyncExecution	Waits until workflow finishes and returns result
Asynchronous	StartExecution	Returns immediately, you must poll for result

Exam Tip:
StartExecution → async
StartSyncExecution → sync
(Always appears in Pro-level exam)

⭐ 5. Use Cases (High Probability Exam Questions)
A. Function Orchestration

Run multiple Lambda functions in order.
Output of one → input of next.

B. Branching (Choice State)

E.g., Credit limit request → approve or reject → manager approval → next step.

C. Human in the Loop

Use Callback + Task Token.

Example:
Stock approval, KYC verification, money transfer approval.

D. Parallel Processing

E.g., Generate multiple video resolutions at same time.

Uses Parallel state.

E. Dynamic Parallelism

Uses Map State
Example:
Processing multiple SQS messages or order items.

🔗 6. Service Integrations (VERY IMPORTANT TABLE)

Step Functions integrates with 200+ services, but exam focuses on patterns:

Integration Patterns

Request-Response

Run Job (Synchronous)

Wait for Callback Task Token

Examples:

Service	RR	Run Job	Callback
Lambda	✔	❌	✔ (via callback)
ECS	✔	✔	✔
Batch	✔	✔	✔
SNS	✔	❌	❌
SQS	✔	❌	❌
Glue	✔	✔	❌
EMR	✔	✔	❌
Step Functions (Nested)	✔	✔	✔

Exam Trap:
SNS + SQS → NO “Run Job”
Glue → No callback
Lambda → supports callback token

Chapter 2: The Workers (States)

The kingdom had different types of workers.

⚒️ 1. Task Worker

The main worker — does all the real work.

Example:
“Go call Lambda!”
“Write to DynamoDB!”

🤔 2. Choice Worker

The wise decision-maker.

Example:
“Is credit score > 700? → Go to Approval Room.”
“Else → Go to Rejection Room.”

😴 3. Wait Worker

The lazy one — sleeps for N seconds.

🪞 4. Pass Worker

Does nothing. Just passes data.

(Think of a chaatwala passing plate to next person 😄)

🎉 5. Succeed Worker

Shouts: “Hurray! Workflow complete!”
