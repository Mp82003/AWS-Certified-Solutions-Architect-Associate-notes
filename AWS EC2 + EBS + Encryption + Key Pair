. EBS (Elastic Block Store) — Key Points (Exam Focus)
📌 Definition

EBS = Durable block-level storage that attaches to EC2.

Works like a hard disk for EC2.

📌 Key Features

Block storage → low latency reads/writes.

Attached to a single EC2 (except Multi-Attach for io2).

Persists even after EC2 stops/terminates (unless delete-on-termination=true).

Can attach multiple EBS volumes to a single EC2.

Volume and EC2 must be in same AZ (Exam HOT).

2. EBS Volume Modifications

You can modify LIVE volumes (no downtime):

Increase Size

Increase IOPS

Change Volume Type (gp2 → gp3, gp3 → io1 etc.)

👉 Exam Tip: Only works for current generation EC2 + EBS.

3. Use Cases

OS boot volume

Databases (MySQL/Postgres)

Applications needing frequent updates

High-throughput workloads (log processing, analytics)

4. EBS Multi-Attach (Exam-Specific)

Supported ONLY for io2 volumes

Can attach one EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances (same AZ).

For clustered Linux apps, shared file systems.

NOT for Windows, NOT for root volume.

5. EBS Encryption (AES-256 + KMS)
📌 Uses KMS Keys

Encryption uses AWS KMS.

Algorithm: AES-256 (Exam must-remember).

📌 Encryption happens on EC2 host

NOT on EBS.

So data at rest + data in transit (EC2 → EBS) is encrypted.

📌 What Gets Encrypted Automatically

Data inside the EBS volume

Data in transit between EC2 ↔ EBS

Snapshots of encrypted volumes

Volumes created from encrypted snapshots

👉 Exam Trick:
Encrypted → snapshot is encrypted → new volume is encrypted.
Unencrypted → snapshot unencrypted unless explicitly encrypted.

6. How to Encrypt an Existing Unencrypted Volume

Steps:

Take snapshot (unencrypted)

Copy snapshot → choose Encrypt

Create new volume from encrypted snapshot

Attach to EC2

7. EC2 Key Pairs (SSH Authentication)
📌 Key Pair = Public Key + Private Key

Used for SSH authentication into EC2.

Public Key

Stored on EC2 instance under:

~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Private Key (.pem file)

Stored by you

Required for SSH login

If lost → cannot recover (Exam point)

Login Requirement
ssh -i mykey.pem ec2-user@public-ip

Security Rule

Never check .pem into GitHub.

Anyone with private key gets full access.

8. Boot Behavior

When EC2 boots first time, it injects the public key into the OS.

For Linux:

Default users: ec2-user, ubuntu, centos, etc.

9. Common Exam Use Cases
Case 1: Lost Private Key

❌ You can’t recover it
✔ Only solution:

Create new key pair

Stop instance

Detach root volume

Attach to another EC2

Add new public key manually

Reattach and boot

Case 2: Need to Encrypt Existing Volume

Snapshot → Copy snapshot (encrypted) → Create new volume

Case 3: EC2 can't access unencrypted + encrypted volumes together?

✔ It CAN. (Exam trick question)

Case 4: Same EBS volume attached to multiple EC2?

✔ Only using io2 Multi-Attach

❌ Not supported for boot/root volume

Case 5: EBS AZ Restriction

Volume & EC2 must be in same AZ

10. Super Quick Revision (30 Seconds Before Exam)

EBS = Block storage

S3 = Object storage

Encryption = KMS + AES-256

Encryption covers: data at rest + transit + snapshots + derived volumes

Modify EBS volume live (size/IOPS/type)

Multi-Attach → io2 volume ⇒ multiple EC2

Lose private key = no recovery

Key injected to: ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


MCQs: EC2 + EBS + Encryption + Key Pairs
1. EBS is what type of storage?

A. Object-level storage
B. File-level storage
C. Block-level storage
D. Queue storage

Answer: C
Explanation: EBS = block storage, S3 = object, EFS = file.

2. When you stop an EC2 instance, what happens to its EBS volume by default?

A. Deleted immediately
B. Persists unless “delete on termination” is enabled
C. Encrypted automatically
D. Converted to S3 storage

Answer: B
Explanation: Root EBS volume persists unless delete-flag is set.

3. Which algorithm is used for EBS encryption?

A. RSA-2048
B. AES-128
C. AES-256
D. SHA-256

Answer: C
Explanation: AWS uses AES-256 with KMS.

4. Where does EBS encryption happen?

A. Inside the EBS volume
B. On the EC2 host
C. On S3
D. In the client machine

Answer: B
Explanation: Encryption happens on the server (EC2 hypervisor layer).

5. Which of the following gets encrypted automatically when an EBS encrypted volume is used?

A. Data in the instance RAM
B. Snapshots
C. Security groups
D. IAM roles

Answer: B
Explanation: Encrypted volume → encrypted snapshot → encrypted new volumes.

6. You want to attach one EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances simultaneously. Which volume type is required?

A. gp2
B. gp3
C. io1
D. io2

Answer: D
Explanation: Only io2 supports Multi-Attach.

7. To attach an EBS volume to an EC2 instance, what must match?

A. VPC IDs
B. AMI IDs
C. Availability Zone
D. Region

Answer: C
Explanation: EBS volumes are AZ-scoped, not region-scoped.

8. What happens if you lose your EC2 private key (.pem)?

A. AWS support can recover it
B. You can download it again
C. You cannot recover it
D. You can regenerate it on instance

Answer: C
Explanation: Lost private key = zero recovery.

9. How is the public key injected into a Linux EC2 instance?

A. IAM role
B. Stored in S3
C. Placed in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys during first boot
D. Sent via email

Answer: C

10. Which is true about EC2 key pairs?

A. Private key stored by AWS
B. Public key stored by user
C. Private key stored by user
D. You can recover private key anytime

Answer: C
Explanation: AWS keeps public, you keep private.

11. You want to encrypt an existing unencrypted EBS volume. What is the correct method?

A. Turn on encryption in-place
B. Reboot instance
C. Snapshot → Copy snapshot (encrypt) → Create new volume
D. Use IAM policy

Answer: C
Explanation: Only snapshot-copy-encrypt works.

12. Which of the following can be modified on a live EBS volume?

A. Size only
B. Size + IOPS + Volume Type
