. EBS (Elastic Block Store) — Key Points (Exam Focus)
📌 Definition
EBS = Durable block-level storage that attaches to EC2.
Works like a hard disk for EC2.

📌 Key Features
Block storage → low latency reads/writes.
Attached to a single EC2 (except Multi-Attach for io2).
Persists even after EC2 stops/terminates (unless delete-on-termination=true).
Can attach multiple EBS volumes to a single EC2.
Volume and EC2 must be in same AZ (Exam HOT).

2. EBS Volume Modifications
You can modify LIVE volumes (no downtime):
Increase Size
Increase IOPS
Change Volume Type (gp2 → gp3, gp3 → io1 etc.)
👉 Exam Tip: Only works for current generation EC2 + EBS.

3. Use Cases
OS boot volume
Databases (MySQL/Postgres)
Applications needing frequent updates
High-throughput workloads (log processing, analytics)

4. EBS Multi-Attach (Exam-Specific)
Supported ONLY for io2 volumes
Can attach one EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances (same AZ).
For clustered Linux apps, shared file systems.
NOT for Windows, NOT for root volume.

5. EBS Encryption (AES-256 + KMS)
📌 Uses KMS Keys
Encryption uses AWS KMS.
Algorithm: AES-256 (Exam must-remember).

📌 Encryption happens on EC2 host
NOT on EBS.
So data at rest + data in transit (EC2 → EBS) is encrypted.

📌 What Gets Encrypted Automatically
Data inside the EBS volume
Data in transit between EC2 ↔ EBS
Snapshots of encrypted volumes
Volumes created from encrypted snapshots

👉 Exam Trick:
Encrypted → snapshot is encrypted → new volume is encrypted.
Unencrypted → snapshot unencrypted unless explicitly encrypted.

6. How to Encrypt an Existing Unencrypted Volume
Steps:
Take snapshot (unencrypted)
Copy snapshot → choose Encrypt
Create new volume from encrypted snapshot
Attach to EC2

7. EC2 Key Pairs (SSH Authentication)
📌 Key Pair = Public Key + Private Key
Used for SSH authentication into EC2.
Public Key
Stored on EC2 instance under:
~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Private Key (.pem file)
Stored by you
Required for SSH login
If lost → cannot recover (Exam point)
Login Requirement
ssh -i mykey.pem ec2-user@public-ip
Security Rule
Never check .pem into GitHub.
Anyone with private key gets full access.

8. Boot Behavior
When EC2 boots first time, it injects the public key into the OS.

For Linux:
Default users: ec2-user, ubuntu, centos, etc.

9. Common Exam Use Cases
Case 1: Lost Private Key
❌ You can’t recover it
✔ Only solution:
Create new key pair
Stop instance
Detach root volume
Attach to another EC2
Add new public key manually
Reattach and boot

Case 2: Need to Encrypt Existing Volume
Snapshot → Copy snapshot (encrypted) → Create new volume

Case 3: EC2 can't access unencrypted + encrypted volumes together?
✔ It CAN. (Exam trick question)

Case 4: Same EBS volume attached to multiple EC2?
✔ Only using io2 Multi-Attach

❌ Not supported for boot/root volume

Case 5: EBS AZ Restriction
Volume & EC2 must be in same AZ

10. Super Quick Revision (30 Seconds Before Exam)
EBS = Block storage
S3 = Object storage
Encryption = KMS + AES-256
Encryption covers: data at rest + transit + snapshots + derived volumes
Modify EBS volume live (size/IOPS/type)
Multi-Attach → io2 volume ⇒ multiple EC2
Lose private key = no recovery
Key injected to: ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

What is EC2 Instance Store?
Ephemeral local block storage directly attached to the physical host of the EC2 instance.
Temporary storage → data lost if instance is stopped, terminated, or fails.
Unlike EBS (persistent), instance store → non-persistent.

2. Why do we need Instance Store?
✔ High Performance
Physically attached → very low latency.
Ideal for high throughput, IO-intensive & temporary data.

✔ Best Use Cases
Cache
Buffer
Scratch space
Temporary processing files
Applications that can recreate data
Big data processing / Hadoop
High-performance workloads

3. Important Characteristics
❗ Data Loss
Data disappears when:
Instance stops
Instance terminates
Host fails
Instance store volume is unmapped
❗ Not for Boot Volume
EC2 instance store cannot be used as OS boot disk.
Booting from instance store = slow + unreliable (exam reminder).

4. Limitations
Not available for all EC2 instance types
(e.g., T2, T3 don’t have instance store)
Capacity is fixed at launch time, cannot resize later.
No snapshots or persistent backup like EBS.
Must handle backup/recovery manually if needed.

5. Block Device Mapping
When launching an instance, you can configure instance store volumes using block device mapping.
Instance store → appears as additional NVMe/SCSI devices.

6. Comparison with EBS
Feature                 	Instance Store                       	EBS
Persistence	               ❌ Temporary                	✔ Persistent
Data Loss	                    On stop/terminate         	Retains data
Performance	                 Very high	                   High but less than instance store
Backup                     	Manual	                      Snapshots
Resize                      	❌ No                      	✔ Yes
Boot Volume               	❌ Not recommended           	✔ YES


7. When to Use Instance Store
Use when:
Data is non-critical
You need extreme IO speed
Application can recreate data
You need cheap, fast, temporary storage

Do NOT use when:
You need permanent storage
Data must survive stops/terminations
You require snapshots/backups

8. Key Exam Tricks
Instance store = ephemeral = temporary
Not all EC2 types have instance store
Data lost on stop/terminate
Can’t resize instance store
Best for cache/buffer/scratch
