What is VPC?

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Logically isolated virtual network in AWS
Your own personal section of AWS Cloud
Complete control over networking environment
Default VPC: Every AWS account has one (cannot be deleted)
Region-bound: Each VPC exists entirely within one region

Key VPC Components
1. Internet Gateway (IGW)

Connects VPC to public internet
One IGW per VPC
Required for public subnet internet access

2. Subnets

Definition: Range of IP addresses within VPC
Purpose: Segment VPC into smaller networks
Location: Each subnet resides in one Availability Zone
Types:

Public Subnet: Has route to Internet Gateway
Private Subnet: No direct internet access



3. Route Tables

Control traffic flow within VPC and to external networks
Default route table: Comes with every VPC
Association: Each subnet must be associated with one route table
Key Routes:

0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway (for public access)
10.0.0.0/16 → Local (for internal VPC traffic)



4. Network ACLs (NACLs)

Subnet-level firewall
Additional security layer
One default NACL per VPC
Stateless (must configure both inbound and outbound rules)

5. NAT Gateway

Enables outbound internet access for private subnets
Must be placed in public subnet
Prevents inbound internet traffic to private resources
Private route table needs: 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway

6. Security Groups

Instance-level firewall
First line of defense for EC2 instances
Stateful (automatic return traffic)

VPC Connectivity Options
VPC Peering

Direct private communication between VPCs
Works across regions
Cost-effective and secure
No internet gateway required

VPN Connections

Secure connection to on-premises networks
Options: Site-to-Site VPN, AWS Client VPN, Direct Connect

Transit Gateway

Central hub for routing traffic
Connects multiple VPCs and on-premises networks
Regional service
Simplifies network management

Subnet Deep Dive
Characteristics

Defined using CIDR notation (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24)
Must be associated with one Availability Zone
Cannot span multiple AZs
Enhance fault tolerance when distributed across AZs

Types & Use Cases

Public Subnets: Web servers, load balancers, NAT gateways
Private Subnets: Databases, application servers, internal services

Routing Behavior

Public Subnet: Route table has route to Internet Gateway
Private Subnet: Route table lacks Internet Gateway route
Custom route tables enable fine-grained traffic control

Exam Key Points

VPC is region-specific, subnets are AZ-specific
Default VPC cannot be deleted
One subnet = One AZ (but one AZ can have multiple subnets)
Security Groups are stateful, NACLs are stateless
NAT Gateway must be in public subnet for private subnet internet access
Route table association determines if subnet is public or private


# AWS VPC - Quick Exam Notes

## VPC Basics
- **VPC**: Logically isolated virtual network in AWS
- **Scope**: Region-specific (cannot span regions)
- **Default VPC**: Auto-created, cannot be deleted
- **Custom VPC**: Full control over IP ranges, subnets, routing

## Core Components

### Internet Gateway (IGW)
- One per VPC
- Enables internet access for public subnets

### Subnets
- **Public**: Route to IGW (0.0.0.0/0 → IGW)
- **Private**: No IGW route
- **Rule**: 1 subnet = 1 AZ (but 1 AZ can have multiple subnets)

### Route Tables
- Default route table per VPC
- Each subnet = exactly 1 route table
- Determines public vs private subnet behavior

### Security
- **Security Groups**: Instance-level, stateful
- **NACLs**: Subnet-level, stateless

### NAT Gateway
- Public subnet placement required
- Enables private subnet outbound internet access
- Private route: 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway

## Connectivity

### VPC Peering
- Direct VPC-to-VPC connection
- Cross-region supported
- No IGW needed

### VPN/Direct Connect
- On-premises connectivity
- Secure encrypted connections

### Transit Gateway
- Central hub for multiple VPCs
- Regional service

## Exam Essentials
- **Stateful**: Security Groups (automatic return traffic)
- **Stateless**: NACLs (manual inbound/outbound rules)
- **Public subnet criteria**: Route table with IGW route
- **Private internet access**: NAT Gateway in public subnet
- **High availability**: Distribute subnets across multiple AZs
