⭐ 1. What is ELB?
ELB (Elastic Load Balancing) distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets:
EC2 instances
Containers
IP addresses
Lambda (ALB only)

Benefits:
High Availability
Fault Tolerance
Automatic scaling
Health checks
SSL/TLS termination
Single point of contact

⭐ 2. How ELB Works (Exam Logic)
Client request → ELB endpoint
ELB listener receives request
ELB performs health checks
ELB selects healthy target using LB algorithm
Forwards request → Target group
Target responds → ELB → Client

⭐ 3. ELB Types (VERY IMPORTANT EXAM TOPIC)
1️⃣ CLB – Classic Load Balancer (Legacy)
Layer 4 (TCP/SSL) + Limited L7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
Very basic
No advanced routing
Exam note → NOT important, just know it's legacy.

✔ Use for: Simple TCP or SSL load balancing
❌ No host/path-based routing
❌ No modern features (WebSockets, HTTP/2, redirects)

2️⃣ NLB – Network Load Balancer (Layer 4)
Layer 4 (TCP, UDP, TLS)
Designed for extreme performance
Handles millions of requests per second
Ultra-low latency (microseconds)

Key Features
Supports Elastic IP (EIP) per AZ
Ideal for real-time apps
Static IP support
Can load balance to:
EC2
IPs
Lambda (via TCP passthrough)
Algorithms
Flow hashing
No path/host-based routing

Exam Trigger Words
✔ “Millions of requests per second”
✔ “Static IP needed”
✔ “TCP/UDP load balancing”
✔ “Low latency / high throughput”
👉 Choose NLB

3️⃣ ALB – Application Load Balancer (Layer 7)
Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
Advanced routing
Best for web applications/microservices

Key Features

Host-based routing (api.example.com → service)
Path-based routing (/images, /login, /api/*)
Query/header-based routing
WebSockets support
HTTP/2
Redirects (HTTP → HTTPS)
Sticky sessions
Target groups: EC2, IPs, Lambda, containers

Exam Trigger Words
✔ “Microservices”
✔ “HTTP headers / URL routing”
✔ “Content-based routing”
✔ “Serverless”
👉 Choose ALB

4️⃣ GWLB – Gateway Load Balancer (Layer 3)
Layer 3 (IP packet level)
Used for virtual appliances like:
Firewalls
IDS/IPS
Deep packet inspection
Security appliances

Key Features
Combines:
Load balancer (scaling appliances)
Gateway (single entry/exit point)
Integrates with GWLB endpoints (GWLBe)

Exam Trigger Words
✔ “Security appliances firewall/IDS/IPS”
✔ “Deep packet inspection”
✔ “Third-party VNFs”
👉 Choose GWLB

⭐ 4. Components (Common Across ELBs)
Load Balancer
Public or internal
Handles listener + provides DNS endpoint
Listeners
Protocol + port mapping

Examples:
ALB: HTTP/HTTPS
NLB: TCP/UDP/TLS
Target Groups
Route traffic to:
EC2
Lambda
Containers
IPs
Health Checks

ALB → HTTP-based
NLB → TCP-based
GWLB → IP-based

⭐ 5. Cross-Zone Load Balancing
Distributes traffic across all AZ targets, even if request arrives in one AZ.
Benefits
Better load distribution
Higher availability
Reduced imbalance problems
Limitations
Extra data transfer cost (for NLB if enabled)
More complex architecture
Important Exam Notes
LB Type	Default	Configurable
ALB	ON	Cannot disable
NLB	OFF	Enable manually
CLB	ON	Can disable
